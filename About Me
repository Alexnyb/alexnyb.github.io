After graduating with an Engineer’s (Master’s) degree in Operational Research Engineering, I began my career 
as math teacher before moving to manufacturers as a Data Analyst. Subsequently, I was hired as a Business 
Intelligence Engineer for HAS company, in the healthcare sector, where I worked on building and maintaining 
data warehouses and ETL data pipeline. then moved to SNCF (French National Railway), where he worked as a Data Engineer, 
for testing ETL data pipeline.

Through my academic and professional experience, I developed strong mathematics, software and data engineering,
including Machine Learning, Python, Snowflake, R, SQL, Alteryx and Tableau. Additionally, I have honed my interpersonal 
skills through direct collaboration with front office teams.
